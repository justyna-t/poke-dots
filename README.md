# Poke the Dots Version 5

This is a graphical game where two dots move around the screen, bouncing
off the edges. When the dots collide, the game ends. The user tries to
prevent the dots from colliding by pressing and releasing the mouse button
to teleport the dots to a random location. The score is the number of
seconds from the start of the game.
