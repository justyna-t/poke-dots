# Poke the Dots Version 7

This is a graphical game where two dots move around the screen, bouncing
off the edges. When the dots collide, the game ends. The user tries to
prevent the dots from colliding by pressing and releasing the mouse button
to teleport the dots to a random location. Every click will speed the game
and change dots color. The score is the number of seconds from the start of
the game until the dots collide. To reset the game after game over,
player should press ENTER.

## How to run

```
$ python3 poke7.py
```

Versions 6 and 7 are independent of the course and are my own solution.
